Hello reader this technical documentation provides a pre-requirement analysis for my sorce code whci goes by file name APIs.py
This code demonstrates the functionality of APIs.
To demonstrate the use of APIs in Python, I'll use the requests library to interact with a public API. 
One common example is using a REST API like OpenWeatherMap to get weather data for a particular city.
First of all you will need the requests library, which can be installed using(in Command Prompt/Powershell):

pip install requests

I have already given the file name above where you can find the source code but just for sake of convenience I will provide the source code here also:

import requests

def get_weather(city, api_key):
    # API endpoint for fetching weather data
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric"

    # Send a GET request to the API
    response = requests.get(url)

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Convert response data (JSON format) to a dictionary
        data = response.json()
        
        # Extract specific information from the data
        weather_description = data['weather'][0]['description']
        temperature = data['main']['temp']
        feels_like = data['main']['feels_like']
        humidity = data['main']['humidity']
        
        # Print weather information
        print(f"Weather in {city.capitalize()}:")
        print(f"Description: {weather_description}")
        print(f"Temperature: {temperature}°C")
        print(f"Feels Like: {feels_like}°C")
        print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
    else:
        print(f"Error: Unable to fetch weather data for {city}. Status code: {response.status_code}")

# Example usage
city = "London"
api_key = "your_openweathermap_api_key"  # Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key
get_weather(city, api_key)
